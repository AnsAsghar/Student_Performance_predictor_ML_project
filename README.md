# Student Performance Predictor using Machine Learning ðŸš€

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict student performance. It starts with data ingestion from a MySQL database, followed by thorough preprocessing and standardization of features, and continues with training multiple regression modelsâ€”Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoostâ€”to select the best performer based on the R2 score. Built with production-ready software engineering practices, the project incorporates modular design, proper error handling, logging, and MLflow integration for experiment tracking.

## Key Steps
1. __Data Ingestion:__ Fetch student data from a MySQL database.
2. __Data Transformation:__ Preprocess and standardize features to prepare for modeling.
3. __Model Training:__ Train multiple regression models to predict student performance.
4. __Model Selection:__ Evaluate models based on R2 score and select the best one.
5. __Artifact Generation:__ Save preprocessed data splits, trained model artifacts, and performance metrics for future use.

## Project Structure
- __data_ingestion/__  
  Handles extraction of student data from the MySQL database.

- __data_transformation/__  
  Contains scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardization.

- __model_training/__  
  Includes modules for training various regression models and selecting the best performer.

- __logging/__  
  Centralizes logging configurations to monitor the execution of the pipeline.

- __mlflow/__  
  Integrates with MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking and performance logging.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AnsAsghar/ML-Project-1.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To check the final score and best model
```
python app.py
```
To run the entire pipeline, execute:
```
python run_pipeline.py
```
This command triggers the complete workflowâ€”from data ingestion to model training and artifact generation.
